# Hex Snake
Snake on a hexagonal board.

When you hit the wall, where you get teleported depends on the direction you were going, makes sense right?

## Controls

#### Movement

It's possible to configure which side of the keyboard you're playing on, with which hand, and the keyboard layout.

As an example, these are the controls for playing on the right side
of the keyboard with the right hand on qwerty (default).

- `J` - Up-Left
- `K` - Up
- `L` - Up-Right
- `M` - Down-Left
- `,` - Down
- `.` - Down-Right

#### Other

- `Space` - Play / Pause

When you die, press `Space` to restart

## Screenshots

The head of the snake is red, the tail is purple,
if you run into yourself, the snake's tail will be
cut off until you manage to regrow it again.

Teleportation depends on direction.

Sometimes you will spawn an AI snake that will
annoyingly compete for your apples (or one that will
try to kill you).
