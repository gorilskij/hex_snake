# Hex Snake
Snake on a hexagonal board.

When you hit the wall, where you get teleported depends on the direction you were going, makes sense right?

## Controls

#### Movement

It's possible to configure which side of the keyboard you're playing on, with which hand, and the keyboard layout.
This can be done by changing the `players` vector in the main method. Currently supported layouts are
qwerty and dvorak.

As an example, these are the controls for playing on the right side
of the keyboard with the right hand on qwerty (default).

- `J` - Up-Left
- `K` - Up
- `L` - Up-Right
- `M` - Down-Left
- `,` - Down
- `.` - Down-Right

#### Other

- `Space` - Play / Pause

When crashed, press `Space` to restart
